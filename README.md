# Cnverg Fun Chat Challenge

## Goals

* Build a basic chat interface
* Integrate with [Giphy API](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI)
* Showing off your design skills is a BIG plus (it doesn't need to be production ready, but, please, don't make it look like shit)


### Chat Interface

The chat should support a _room_ with unlimited number of participants and allow sending and receiving messages among them.


### Giphy Integration

Add some fun by integrating [Giphy](http://giphy.com) such that a message like `/giphy I'm so excited` searches the API and becomes the first image returned from the result set.


## Setup and Delivery

This repository provides a working, _arguably acceptable_ express application structure. Feel free to use it and change it as desired.

When ready, drop us a line at jobs@cnverg.com with either a link to a repository of your own or a pull request.
